## Featured Whiskeys (large table by windows)

- Russell's Reserve Single Barrel Bourbon: Peculiarly light on the nose, this one shines through with remarkably smooth flavors and a bright vanilla finish, at least for me...what do you think?

- Joseph Magnus Straight Bourbon Whiskey: Whoa. This is some break-da-mouth stuff, with intense and rich flavors all round. Among my personal favorites.

- Southwell 12-Year Bourbon: 84% corn, 8% rye, and 8% malted barley, this shows off how much grain choice can affect whiskey, with intensely sweet corn flavors predominating.

- Oregon Spirit 4-Year Bourbon: This young (4-year) bourbon is a great contrast for some of the mellower long-aged bourbons on offer tonight.

- Anchor Distilling Old Potrero Straight Rye Whiskey: Anchor doesn't just make Anchor Steam!

- Whistlepig 10-Year: Distilled in Canada, this is a phenomenal example of a well-made rye. The 10-year aging gives it a somewhat more mellow flavor than the Old Potrero Rye. Check out the tasting notes on the neck of the bottle and see if you agree!

## Scotches (small table by fireplace)

- Glendronach 12: A typical "Speyside" scotch.

- Laphoaig 10: This is an iconic "Islay" (eye-luh) scotch, full of the smoky smells of the peat dug out of the ground and used to smoke the malts. Everybody's got an opinion about Islay scotches. What's yours?

## Surprises (small table by fireplace)

Left blank as an exercise for the drinker.

## Odds and Ends

- Anchor Distilling Christmas Spirit: Each year, Anchor takes the unsold remainder of its heavily-spiced winter ale and distills it into this white whiskey. Never aged in barrels, much of the flavor here is coming from the spices used to flavor the original winter beer. Truly distinctive. Earlier batches (before about 2013) were known as White Christmas rather than Christmas Spirit, but the Bing Crosby estate eventually caught on and threatened a lawsuit.

- Angel's Envy Finished Rye (Rum Cask): Angel's Envy is a great whiskey to begin with, and this one has been finished for a short amount of time in casks previously used to age rum. The sweetness and fragrance of rum is apparent, and only serves to further improve a fine offering.

- Old Tahoe Straight Rye Whiskey: The single highest-proof whiskey I've ever had, and you can taste every percent. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of the stuff. But perhaps it'll be your jam?
