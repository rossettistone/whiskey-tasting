# How to Taste

### Steps

1. Smell: Get your nose into it! Some will give you a lot, some not much. Some will just burn your nostrils - watch out!
1. Sip
1. Swallow: There are tons of taste buds far back in your mouth. Let 'em get a taste.
1. Exhale nasally (retronasal smell): This is where you'll get *most* of your smell experience. An incredible number of your smell receptors are only available when exhaling after swallowing something. You should get *tons* of stuff here that you didn't smell or taste at first. 

### Flavors

Flavor in whiskey comes from three main elements:

- Grain: Toasted grain of all sorts is going to taste...toasty. Look for the flavor of the original grain (e.g. does it taste like corn?), as well as bready or cracker notes.

- Barrels: Barrels prive a scent of oak, may introduce a lightly burnt flavor (as the barrels are typically charred on the inside), and tend to produce a more "mellow" flavor in whiskeys aged about 10 or more years.

- Yeast: While every yeast is different, yeast tends to produce flavors that are  "fruity" and smells that are spicy. If you're tasting plums, pears, peach, or apples; or smelling vanilla or peppercorns, that's yeast.

### Tasting notes

While it might seem goofy at first, it can be really helpful to express what you're tasting in terms of other smells and flavors that you know. How about some of these, just to get you started:

Smells like: 

- allspice

- ginger

- nutmeg

- anise

- clove

- orange peel

- oak

- char

- caramel


# How whiskey is made (the quick version):
1. Malt: Moisten grain and heat or toast it just a little to break down the sugars and make it taste a little sweet.
2. Mash: Soak the grain in hot water to extract the sugars.
3. Ferment: Add yeast to the mash and wait for the yeast to convert the sugars to alcohol and add a variety of flavors (often fruity flavors and spicy smells, depending on the yeast). This will likely raise the alcohol level to 15 or 20%
4. Distill: Boil away some of the water to concentrate the alcohol and flavors.
5. (optional) Barrel: Stick the whiskey into barrels for an amount of time between a few months and a few decades.



# Key terms:

- Proof: A rating of how much alcohol is in a drink. For the percentage, divide the proof by two.

- Cask-strength: Whiskey typically comes of of barrels at somewhere between 50 and 70% alcohol, and is then diluted down to 40% for commercial sale. Many of the whiskeys being served this evening have *not* been diluted, and are referred to as "cask strength" (if they're at the original proof) or "high proof" (if the proof has been reduced, but not to 40%).

- Mash: A blend of grains (barley, corn, wheat, rye, etc.) mixed with water and heated to make the initial sugary "tea" from which whiskey is then fermented.

- Bourbon: A whiskey produced with at least 51% corn mash.

- Rye: By US standards, a whiskey produced with at least 51% rye mash.

- Sour mash: A whiskey produced by starting with a small amount of fermented mash from the previous batch.

- Chill-filtering: When unfiltered whiskey is chilled, it has a tendency to cloud up. This is a result of certain naturally-occurring fats and proteins clumping up at low temperatures. To prevent this clouding (purely for aesthetic purposes), some producers chill the whiskey and filter it. While the resulting product may be more visual appealing, some say that subtle flavors are lost in the process.

- "Straight" (e.g. "straight rye whiskey"): This term denotes that no other (non-whiskey) spirits have been blended into the product, and that it has been aged for at least two years.
